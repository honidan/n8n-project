# About these n8n Projects

I have no programming background, and now learning to use **n8n**. Feeling the magic. 

Through this process, I aim to automate parts of my work to improve work efficiency.  At the same time, I hope that working on these **n8n projects** will help me gradually understand the fundamental principles behind how programs work.  

Anyway, if my projects can also be helpful to you, please feel free, take it anytime.
